   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

The Combinatorial Optimist
==================================================

Blogging for applied, computational and interdisciplinary mathematics.  Thematically, posts will describe a wide variety of topics including high-dimensional data science (mining/preprocessing/storage/analysis), complex systems, newtork science, social networks, biological systems, artificial intelligence, intelligent systems, critical infrasturcures, information technology, nonlinear dynamics, statistical physics, etc. Mathematically, posts may describe mathematical modeling, numerical analysis, probability theory, statistical inference, random-matrix theory, computational topology, high-dimensional geometry, etc. Application-focused applied mathematicians understand and utilize a diverse set of mathematical techniques, and you can too.

Never forget the Combinatorial Optimist Motto: Keep trying. You can do it!

New let's get math-ing.

.. `toctree` directive, below, contains list of non-post `.rst` files.
   This is how they appear in Navigation sidebar. Note that directive
   also contains `:hidden:` option so that it is not included inside the page.

   Posts are excluded from this directive so that they aren't double listed
   in the sidebar both under Navigation and Recent Posts.
