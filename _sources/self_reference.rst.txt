How I created this this blog
============================

I created this blog following the introduction descibed at
https://ablog.readthedocs.io/. \* First I installed the python modules
Sphynx and ABlog using "conda install ...." \* Then, in I entered "ablog
start" into the terminal. \* Next, I created a new jupyter notebook,
which you can see at \_static/self\_reference.ipynb see here, which
contains exactly what you are reading. \* After that, I saved the .ipynb
file as a .rst file, which I moved into the folder for my ablog. \*
Next, I entered "ablog build" into the terminal. And voila!

At the top of each jupyter notebook, I write info about the blog such
as:
